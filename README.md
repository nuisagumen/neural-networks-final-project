# neural-networks-final-project
A final project that my my group and I did for the Neural Network course in the University of Groningen.


We decided to work with electrocardiogram data (which helps with determination of heart-related problems). 
It was shown recent developments in the area of Neural Networks prove that machine learning models trained on ECG-recordings are now able to detect and classify present arrhythmias more accurately than trained cardiologists. Similarly, the aim of our project was to create and train a 1-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can classify pathological heartbeats, based on data given in the MIT-BIH dataset. We used Accuracy, Loss, Recall, Precision and the F1 Score in order to assess the performance of our model. The results suggested that our model performed significantly better on classification of Normal heartbeats than other types of arrhythmias.
